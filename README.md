<h1>Implementation of remote DNS cache poisoning</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
The goal of this project is for students to experience the remote DNS cache poisoning attack, commonly known as the Kaminsky DNS attack. The Domain Name System (DNS) functions as the Internet's directory service, converting domain names into IP addresses and vice versa. This process of DNS resolution typically occurs seamlessly in the background. However, DNS Pharming attacks can disrupt this resolution process, redirecting users to unintended, often malicious, destinations. This lab specifically examines the DNS Cache Poisoning attack, a particular method of DNS Pharming.
